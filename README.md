This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined index.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a solution to handle such situations gracefully. This is a crucial topic for developers to understand to prevent unexpected program termination or incorrect results.  The solutions presented focus on safe array access techniques.
